# Project Overview

## Project Summary

% Briefly describe the project, its objectives, and the open source software it focused on.

The Economics profession has fallen behind other fields in software development and reproducibility practices. To address this problem, [Econ-ARK] has been working on [REMARK], a set of standards and tools for reproducibility in our own work in Economics. The objective of REMARKs is to be self-contained and complete projects, whose contents should be executable by anyone on any computer (as long as it meets a minimal set of requirements and software).

The goal of this project is to expand the REMARK standard to allow for the use of modern scientific publishing technologies such as Jupyter notebooks and [MyST] markdown, and extend the REMARK standard to integrate with modern scientific publishing technologies.

## Target Audience

% Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of the project? Are there secondary groups that benefit?

This project is primarily targeted at the Economics profession, including students, researchers, and practitioners, who are interested in reproducibility and open science. However, this project is not limited to the field of Economics, and is intended to be a useful resource for any field that uses scientific publishing technologies.

## Code Repository

% Please include links to publicly available code repositories.

This project is a colaboration between the [Econ-ARK] team and [Curvenote]. The [REMARK] standard can be found at the [REMARK GitHub repository](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK), but much of the code generated during this project has been integrated into the [MyST] project.

# Project Activities and Progress

## Work Completed

% Clearly outline the activities undertaken during the grant period. Did
% you achieve all your planned goals? If not, explain why and what was accomplished instead.

The goal of this project was to engage with and integrate the [MyST] markdown tools into the [REMARK] project to expand the range of tools available for the standard. To do this, we established a running meeting with the [Curvenote] team (among whom the majority of the MyST core developers work) to brainstorm the best way to integrate MyST into REMARK.

### Colaboration with Myst/Curvenote

Throughout the project, we used the following issue to track our progress:

- [REMARK #152: Improvements to MyST Markdown](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK/issues/152)

### Student generation of REMARKs

### Presentation of REMARK project at CEF 2024

## Technical Milestones

% Discuss any specific technical milestones achieved, such as code
% releases, documentation updates, or bug fixes. Quantify accomplishments with metrics
% where possible (e.g., user growth, code contributions).

## Challenges and Solutions

% Share any challenges encountered during the project and
% how you addressed them.

# Outcomes and Impact

## Project Impact

% Describe the positive impact of the project on the Hopkins community,
% the open source software ecosystem, or any other relevant groups. Use concrete
% examples and data to support your claims where possible.

## Community Engagement

% Did you actively engage with the open source community
% through contributions, conferences, or workshops? Share details and metrics of
% participation.

## Sustainability and Future Plans

% Explain how the project will be sustained beyond the grant
% period. Are there plans for future development, funding, or community support? Is there potential for further impact?

## Lessons Learned

% Share key takeaways and insights gained from the project.

% ## Attachments

% Include relevant documents such as screenshots, code samples,
% documentation updates, or presentations.

# Financial Information

## Grant Expenditures

% Provide a detailed breakdown of how the grant funds were used.
% This should be consistent with the approved budget in the grant proposal.

## Budget Variance

% Explain any significant deviations from the original budget.
