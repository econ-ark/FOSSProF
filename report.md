# Project Overview

**Project Title:** Reproducibility Standards for Economics

## Project Summary

The Economics profession has fallen behind other fields in software development and reproducibility practices. To address this problem, [Econ-ARK] has been working on [REMARK], a set of standards and tools for reproducibility in our own work in Economics. The objective of REMARKs is to be self-contained and complete projects, whose contents should be executable by anyone on any computer that meets a minimal set of requirements and software. The goal of this project is to expand the REMARK standard to allow for the use of modern scientific publishing technologies such as Jupyter notebooks and [MyST] markdown, and extend the REMARK standard to integrate with modern scientific publishing technologies.

## Target Audience

This project is primarily targeted at the Economics profession, including students, researchers, and practitioners, who are interested in reproducibility and open science. However, this project is not limited to the field of Economics, but is intended to be a useful resource for any field that uses scientific publishing technologies.

## Code Repository

This project is a colaboration between the [Econ-ARK] team and [Curvenote]. The [REMARK] standard can be found at the [REMARK GitHub repository](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK), but much of the code generated during this project has been integrated into the [MyST] project.

# Project Activities and Progress

## Work Completed

The goal of this project was to engage with and integrate the [MyST] markdown tools into the [REMARK] project to expand the range of tools available for the standard. To do this, we established a running meeting with the [Curvenote] team (among whom the majority of the MyST core developers work) to brainstorm the best way to integrate MyST into REMARK.

Throughout the project, we used the following issue to track our progress:

- [REMARK #152: Improvements to MyST Markdown](https://github.com/econ-ark/REMARK/issues/152)
